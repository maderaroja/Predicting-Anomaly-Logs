# Predicting-Anomoloy-Logs
I employed Scikit Learn Dummy and Random Forest Classification functions to perform Supervised Machine Learning on the HDFS log files. The results illustrate the successful training of the computer to correctly label log files as anomalous or as normal. The precision scores are 0.95 and 0.99 with recall at 0.60 and 1, and F1-scores at 0.74, and 0.99 respectfully.
